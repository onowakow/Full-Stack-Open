## Git tricks  

$ git status

    --> reveals the status of files in local folder. When adding a new file, it will be 'untracked'


$ git add .

    --> tells git to track a given file. Git does not automatically track a file in the local folder.

    --> each time a file is modified, it should be tracked.


$ git commit -m "Here is a description of my commit." -m "Some description"

    --> Commits are local.


$ git push

    --> Pushes commits to remote repository
